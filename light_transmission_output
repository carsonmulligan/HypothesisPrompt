        <expected_outcome>
            Information in all groups should be transmitted at or below the speed of light (approximately 299,792,458 meters per second).

    <simulation>
        <method>
            A combination of real-world experiments with electromagnetic signals, quantum entanglement experiments with Bell tests, and simulated data for hypothetical superluminal transmission models.
        </method>
        <steps>
            1. Measure the speed of electromagnetic signals over a controlled distance.
            2. Perform quantum entanglement experiments to test if any information can be transmitted faster than light.
            3. Simulate tachyon-based or wormhole transmission models and measure theoretical speeds.
        </steps>
    </simulation>
    <data_collection>
        <expected_data>
            Speeds recorded in classical transmission should match the speed of light.
            Quantum experiments should show correlations without faster-than-light communication.
            Hypothetical models may provide simulation outputs, but need experimental validation.

        <conclusion>
            Based on experimental and simulated data, either the hypothesis will be supported (no faster-than-light transmission) or falsified (if any group shows speeds exceeding light).
